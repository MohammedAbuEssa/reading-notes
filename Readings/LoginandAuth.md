1. What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?

   Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network.

2. Share some an example of RBAC including all possible CRUD operations and correlating roles.

- Management role scope – it limits what objects the role group is allowed to manage.
- Management role group – you can add and remove members.
- Management role – these are the types of tasks that can be performed by a specific role group.
- Management role assignment – this links a role to a role group.

3. What are the Benefits of RBAC?

- Reducing administrative work and IT support.
- Maximizing operational efficiency.
- Improving compliance.

### `Compare and Contrast the following two Libraries and the following questions. Yes, they are similarly named.`

### [react-cookie library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-cookie)

### [react-cookies component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-cookies)

1. Describe some react-cookie features.

- `Easy Cookie Management:` React-Cookie provides a simple and straightforward way to manage cookies in React applications. It allows you to set, get, and delete cookies with ease.

- `Universal Support:` This library can be used both on the client and server-side (universal/isomorphic), which is useful for handling cookies in server-rendered React applications.

- `Lightweight:` React-Cookie is a lightweight library with minimal dependencies, making it a good choice for projects where performance and bundle size are critical.

- `Typescript Support:` It has good TypeScript support, providing type definitions for better development with TypeScript.

2. Describe some react-cookies features.

- `Context API Integration:` React-Cookies integrates with React's Context API, allowing you to access and manage cookies across your entire application by wrapping components with a CookiesProvider.

- `Cookie Scopes:` React-Cookies supports the concept of cookie scopes, which allows you to isolate cookies to specific parts of your application. This can be useful for managing different sets of cookies for different features or components.

- `Comprehensive Documentation:` React-Cookies comes with comprehensive documentation, making it easier for developers to get started and understand how to use it effectively.

- `Controlled and Uncontrolled Components:` It offers a choice between controlled and uncontrolled components for managing cookies, providing flexibility in how you work with cookies in your application.

3. Which library would you prefer would you prefer? Why?

- ### Preference:
- The choice between react-cookie and react-cookies may depend on your specific project requirements and personal preferences. Here are some considerations:

- `Use Case:` If you need a simple and lightweight solution for managing cookies and don't require advanced features like cookie scopes, react-cookie might be a suitable choice.

- `Advanced Features:` If your project involves more complex cookie management scenarios, such as handling cookies across different parts of your application or using the Context API for state management, react-cookies might be a better fit due to its features and flexibility.

- `Community and Documentation:` Consider the availability of community support and documentation. Both libraries have their documentation, but you may want to check if one has more active maintenance or a larger user base, which can be helpful when seeking assistance or finding solutions to common issues.

- `Project Requirements:` Ultimately, your choice should align with your project's specific requirements and your team's familiarity with the library. You may want to try both libraries in a small test project to see which one feels more comfortable and meets your needs.

It's important to note that the React ecosystem evolves quickly, so it's a good practice to check for the latest updates and community feedback on these libraries to make an informed decision based on the current state of the ecosystem.
