1. What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?

EventEmitter that allows us to get started incorporating Event-Driven Programming in our project right away.

2. What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?

OOP promotes the idea that each individual unit or object should handle its own behavior through code contained within that unit. This approach involves building applications with multiple units that interact with each other.

3. Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.

Event-Driven Programming in the backend using Node.js allows the server to efficiently handle multiple events and requests. It makes the server scalable, modular, and suitable for real-time applications. It's like having a kitchen staff that listens for orders and reacts promptly, ensuring efficient request processing and a smooth user experience.
