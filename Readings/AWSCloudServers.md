# AWS: Cloud Servers

### [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)

1. What is an EC2 Instance?

   Secure and resizable compute capacity for virtually any workload.

2. Name 2 use cases for EC2.

- Run cloud-native and enterprise applications.
- Train and deploy ML applications.

3. Provide 1 reason to use ECS instead of a service such as Heroku, Digital Ocean, or Render.com.<br><br>
   If you are interested in staying at AWS only and don’t want to be cloud-agnostic, then go for AWS ECS instead of AWS EKS1.

### [EC2 For Humans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZMkgOMYYIg)

1. Where can we find EC2 on the AWS Console?

   We can find EC2 under the compute section.

2. Explain the general difference between T2 Micro and XL.

   T2 Micro is a smaller and more affordable AWS EC2 instance with lower CPU, memory, and network performance. T2 XL is a larger and more powerful instance with higher CPU, memory, and network capabilities, making it better suited for resource-intensive workloads.

3. Explain a “Compute Cycle” to a non-technical friend.
   Imagine that you want to have a machine that computes large amount of data, and these machines need maintenance a cooling, the computing make it easier on where you can rent a cloud machine.

2. Describe the relationship between EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk.

Elastic Beanstalk leverages EC2 instances to deploy and run applications. Under the hood, Elastic Beanstalk provisions and manages the necessary EC2 instances to host the application.

3. Name some benefits of using Elastic Beanstalk:
