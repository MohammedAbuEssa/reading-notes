## Data Modeling

**1. What type of database is the best fit for the complex query intensive environment?**
SQL DataBase

**2. What type of database is the best fit for hierarchical data storage?**
NoSQL DataBase

**3. Describe the differences in scalability between a SQl and NoSQL database as though you were speaking to a non-technical friend.**

SQL scalability For example, if you have a tall building and you want to add more floors, you have to add more structure and iron so the building can handle it, but if you have a compound and you want to build more houses, you can just buy new land and build on top of it.

**1. Among data tables, what is a one-to-many relationship and how do we “relate” them?**
One to many is used to refer to an item that has more than one item related to it in the second table.

**2. Prior to designing your relational database, it might be useful to create a diagrams of the database tables and their relationships.**

**3. Explain the difference between a primary and foreign key.**
Primary is unique to the table, and we use it to identify and relate things; foreign can be not unique.

**1. How do we treat keywords and parameters differently in SQL syntax?**

Keywords in SQL are reserved words with specific meanings and functions. They define SQL statements. Examples include SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, FROM, WHERE, JOIN, ORDER BY, and GROUP BY.

Parameters in SQL are used to pass values dynamically. They allow flexible queries by substituting placeholders with actual values at runtime.
**2. Define normalization within the context of schemas and data.**
Normalization in databases eliminates redundancy, improves integrity, and optimizes queries. It involves structuring data into smaller tables for efficient storage and retrieval.

**3. Explain the difference between one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships to a non-technical recruiter.**
One to one is like your relation between you and your passport,
One to many is like you and your clothes,
Many to many is like the relation between the students and the courses.
