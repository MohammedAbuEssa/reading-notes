# Data Structures and Algorithms

First thing is why data structure is important, in the software development field the data structure is one of the most important things because its a ways and technologies to store the data and manipulate the data, also the Algorithms are important because whiteout the algorithms we won't have any programs, in simple words the algorithms are sequence of action to perform an action or solve a problem.

\*\*1-What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem? The 'Big O' notation.

\*\*2-How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack? By adding base case.
