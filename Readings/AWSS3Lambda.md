### [AWS Lambda Basics](https://www.serverless.com/aws-lambda)

1. What is AWS Lambda?

   AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Users of AWS Lambda create functions, self-contained applications written in one of the supported languages and runtimes, and upload them to AWS Lambda, which executes those functions in an efficient and flexible manner.

2. Name some use cases for AWS Lambdas.

   - Data processing.
   - calable APIsز

3. Describe “serverless” to a non-technical friend.

   "Serverless" is a way of building websites or applications without having to worry about setting up or managing servers. It allows you to focus on writing code and developing your idea without getting caught up in the technical details of server maintenance.

### [CDN](https://cyberhoot.com/cybrary/content-delivery-network-cdn/)

1. What is a CDN?<br>
   A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a geographically distributed group of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content. A CDN allows for the fast transfer of data needed for loading Internet content including HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos.

2. How does a CDN work with relation to the website visitor?

   A CDN helps make websites load faster for visitors by storing and delivering content from servers located closer to them, reducing the time it takes to access the website.

3. What are the benefits of employing a CDN?

   Employing a CDN doesn’t only speed up the delivery of Internet content, it helps protect your website against certain forms of cyber attacks, such as Denial of Service attacks. It protects against these threats because CDNs allow for the handling of more traffic and withstanding hardware failure better than many origin servers.
