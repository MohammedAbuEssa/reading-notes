### Linked Lists

A linked list is a computer science data structure utilized for storing and managing collections of elements. It comprises a sequence of nodes, with each node containing a data element and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.

In contrast to arrays that store elements in contiguous memory locations, linked lists consist of scattered nodes spread throughout memory, interconnected by these links. This arrangement allows for dynamic memory allocation and facilitates efficient insertion and removal operations.

Different types of linked lists exist, including singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists. In a singly linked list, each node has a reference to the next node, forming a unidirectional sequence. Doubly linked lists, on the other hand, have nodes with references to both the next and previous nodes, creating a bidirectional sequence. Circular linked lists resemble singly or doubly linked lists, but the last node in the list points back to the first node, forming a circular structure.

Linked lists offer advantages in specific scenarios. They provide flexibility in terms of size since memory can be dynamically allocated as required. Insertion and deletion operations can be efficient, particularly at the beginning or end of the list, as they only necessitate adjusting the relevant links. However, linked lists also have drawbacks, such as slower access times for random elements and additional memory overhead for maintaining the node links.

All in all, linked lists serve as a fundamental data structure in various applications and act as a foundation for other complex data structures like stacks, queues, and hash tables.
