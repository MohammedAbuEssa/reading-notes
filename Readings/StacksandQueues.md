# Quiz: Stacks and Queues

1. What is the fundamental difference between a stack and a queue?

   - a) A stack follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, whereas a queue follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.
   - b) A stack allows elements to be inserted and removed from both ends, whereas a queue only allows insertion at one end and removal at the other end.
   - c) A stack has a fixed size, whereas a queue can dynamically resize itself.
   - d) A stack supports parallel processing, whereas a queue supports sequential processing.

2. Which operation in a stack allows you to add an element to the top of the stack?

   - a) enqueue()
   - b) push()
   - c) add()
   - d) insert()

3. Which operation in a stack allows you to remove an element from the top of the stack?

   - a) dequeue()
   - b) pop()
   - c) remove()
   - d) extract()

4. Which data structure is suitable for implementing an undo/redo functionality?

   - a) Stack

   - d) Array

5. In a queue, which end is used for adding elements?

   - a) Front
   - b) Rear
   - c) Top
   - d) Bottom

6. What is the time complexity for accessing the top element in a stack or the front element in a queue?

   - a) O(1)
   - b) O(log n)
   - c) O(n)
   - d) O(n log n)

7. Which operation in a queue allows you to remove an element from the front of the queue?

   - a) enqueue()
   - b) push()
   - c) dequeue()
